## Getting Output in the CSV file
For getting output in the csv file we can try this with two methods.

### Approach 1
You can directly use the following comand in the terminal:
`cargo run >> filename.csv`
This creates the csv file with the respective filename in the respective project file.

### Approach 2
We can also get this CSV file in the script itself by adding the `csv` dependency.
