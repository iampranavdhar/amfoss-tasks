# HackerRank Problems:

**My hackerRank Username is: nspranv**
**My Rank in this Contest is '14'**
**My Score in this Contest is '747.88'**

Being from the non-CS background I had no knowledge of any programming language so I had tried to solve some of them using the knowledge that I had gained by listening to CS50 lectures i.e in  C language and other problems are done in Python which I gained some knowledge in the college lecturers and Programming with Mosh tutorial on Python.

And I found this task to be challenging and getting all the test cases passed is really tough(Atleast for me at this point of time).I had atempted all the problems but I had satisfied all the test cases in five of them and other are partially correct.

Before the deadline of the tasks I had done 5 problems and now I had completed other 5 by gaining the knowledge I had gained during these days.
