# HackerRank Problems:
Being from the non-CS background I had no knowledge of any programming language so I had tried to solve some of them using the knowledge that i had gained by listening to CS50 lectures i.e in  C language and some are done in Python which I gained some knowledge in the college lecturers.And I am trying my level best to solve the rest of them.

And my hackerRank Username is: nspranv
