I had tried my level best to understand the Script given and debugged the bugs that are there in the script.

## Bugs that are identified are:
1.The library that is imported is made as a Comment.\n
2.The start and stop buttons are entered reversely.\n
3.I found 8 errors in which 7 are of semicolons and 1 is of parenthesis.\n
4.Arithmetic operations are given wrong for addition given *,for subtraction given /,.... /n
5.correctCount and worngCount are given as correctCount-- and worngCount += respectively(it should be correctCount++ and worngCount ++)\n
6.First it is mentioned as QuestionLabel again in the further use it is used as questionLabel which is undefined.\n

I hope I had debugged all the bugs that are there in the Script.\n

Thank You.\n
