**a.Why must we choose you?**

I love coding.Eventhough I am not from the CS background, I had interest to learn these.This interest made me to pursue CSE.Since the club is so active I can learn from the members of the club.And it can provide me the great environment and exposure.

**b.What is your plan for the next six months?**

My plan for the next six months is to work hard for getting into the club,contribute my work in the club and also to secure a decent CGPA.

**c.How would you contribute back to the club?**

I would contribute back to the club by sharing my knowledge with my mates and also by guiding my junoirs in the same way as my seniors doing to me.

**d.Do you have any feedback for the selection process?**

Frankly speaking being new to the Computer Science environment I myself not clear about all the tasks given,but learning and doing one by one.One thing which I can say is mentors are really helpful and replying to all the doubts that are being asked by us very fast.
